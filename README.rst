py3odb
======

Python 3.6+ compatible interface to ECMWF’s ODB API

Overview
--------

ODB API was developed by the `European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts`_ for “encoding and processing of observational data.” The
`ODB API`_ provides an SQL-like interface called odbsql, along with a
Python 2 compatible API.

This module was written to provide an interface to ODB API using Python
>=3.6. It requires access to libOdb provided by ODB API.

Usage
-----

py3odb follows the `Python Database API Specification`_:

::

   import py3odb
   connection = py3odb.connect('foo.db')
   cursor = connection.cursor()
   cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM "foo.db"')
   for row in cursor:
       print(row)
   connection.close()

For single queries, there is a Reader context manager and <odb> tag:

::

   import py3odb
   with py3odb.Reader('foo.db', 'SELECT * FROM <odb>') as odb_reader:
       for row in odb_reader:
           print(row)

Known Limitations
-----------------

The intent of this library is to read odb2 files generated by the
`Unified Model`_ for the purpose of observation monitoring. The
underlying odbql interface to the ODB API provided by ECMWF does not
support database operations in a traditional sense. For example: \* as
of ODB API version 17.6, odbql only supports 8 character strings \* only
the most recent INSERT command is accepted \* you cannot open an
existing odb file and do an INSERT
